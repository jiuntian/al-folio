Fast Image Retrieval (FIRe) is an open source image retrieval project release by Center of Image and Signal Processing Lab (CISiP Lab), Universiti Malaya. This framework implements most of the major binary hashing methods, together with different popular backbone networks and public datasets.

Check out our github repository at <a href="https://github.com/CISiPLab/cisip-FIRe">here</a> and read our <a href="https://fast-image-retrieval.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">documentation</a> for detail.

I started this open source project and maintaining it at the moment.
