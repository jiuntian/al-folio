  abs={A deep hashing model typically has two main learning objectives: to make the learned binary hash codes discriminative and to minimize a quantization error. With further constraints such as bit balance and code orthogonality, it is not uncommon for existing models to employ a large number (>4) of losses. This leads to difficulties in model training and subsequently impedes their effectiveness. In this work, we propose a novel deep hashing model with only . Specifically,  we show that maximizing the cosine similarity between the continuous codes and their corresponding  can ensure both hash code discriminativeness and quantization error minimization. Further, with this learning objective, code balancing can be achieved by simply using a  Batch Normalization (BN) layer and multi-label classification is also straightforward with label smoothing. The result is a one-loss deep hashing model that removes all the hassles of tuning the weights of various losses. Importantly,  extensive experiments show that our model is highly effective, outperforming the state-of-the-art multi-loss hashing models on three large-scale instance retrieval benchmarks, often by significant margins. },
