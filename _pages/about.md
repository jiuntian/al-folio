My name is Hoe Jiun Tian (何俊添). I am currently second year PhD student in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore under supervision of Prof Tan Yap Peng and Prof Jiang Xudong. Previously, I did research in computer vision and deep learning under supervision of Prof Chan Chee Seng in my undergraduate study in University of Malaya,.

<!-- Before I start my undergraduate studies, I am interested in programming, electronics, 3D printing, and interplay between them. I likes to make some small automation projects that make my life easier. -->
