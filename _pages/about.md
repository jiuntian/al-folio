My name is Hoe Jiun Tian (何俊添). I am currently final year Computer Science undergraduate studying in University of Malaya. I am currently doing research in computer vision and deep learning under supervision of Prof Chan Chee Seng.

Before I start my undergraduate studies, I am interested in programming, electronics, 3D printing, and interplay between them. I likes to make some small automation projects that make my life easier.
